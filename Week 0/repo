# RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program by Sanjay 🏆

Welcome to the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** repository!  
This project documents the journey from RTL design to GDSII tapeout, utilizing the OpenLane flow with the SkyWater 130nm PDK.

## 📁 Week0 / Task0: OpenLane Installation & Setup

In this task, we focus on installing and configuring **OpenLane**, the open-source RTL-to-GDSII flow.  
It will serve as our primary toolchain for designing, synthesizing, placing, routing, and finally generating layout for the chip.
